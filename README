This is an haxe port of the defaut facebook application.
It uses nodejs externals for haxe so that you can use your favorite lightspeed compiler with this awesome technology.

You need to follow the facebook tutorial to create a new app and then compile this haxe code to replace the javascript one.

You will need to install some haxe libraries:

haxelib install nodejs
haxelib install nodejs_externs

Enjoy!
